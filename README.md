# GeoDecode

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/sdwillbrand/GeoDecode.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sdwillbrand/GeoDecode)

GeoDecode is a Go package that provides offline reverse geocoding. It allows you to find the nearest city and country for a given latitude and longitude coordinate.

## What it Does

This package takes a geographic coordinate (latitude and longitude) and returns the name of the closest known city and its country code. It's designed for quick lookups using an embedded dataset.
Features

- Offline Reverse Geocoding: Works without an internet connection after initial setup.

- City and Country Lookup: Provides the name of the nearest city and its ISO Alpha-2 country code.

- Fast Lookups: Uses a KD-Tree for efficient nearest neighbor searches on a large dataset.

- Embedded Data: The necessary geographic data is bundled directly into the package.

## Installation

To use GeoDecode in your Go project, you can install it using go get:

```go get github.com/sdwillbrand/GeoDecode```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use GeoDecode in your Go application:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/sdwillbrand/GeoDecode" // Import the GeoDecode package
)

func main() {
	// Define a coordinate (e.g., Berlin, Germany)
	coords := [2]float64{52.5200, 13.4050}

	// Find the nearest location.
	// The 'true' argument enables verbose logging during the initial data load.
	location := geodecode.FindLocation(coords, true)

	if location != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Found Location:\n")
		fmt.Printf("  Name: %s\n", location.Name)
		fmt.Printf("  Country Code: %s\n", location.CC)
		fmt.Printf("  Latitude: %.5f, Longitude: %.5f\n", location.Lat, location.Lon)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Location not found for the given coordinates.")
	}

	// Example with an ocean coordinate (will return the nearest land location)
	oceanCoords := [2]float64{0.0, 0.0}
	oceanLocation := geodecode.FindLocation(oceanCoords, false) // No verbose logging for subsequent calls

	if oceanLocation != nil {
		fmt.Printf("\nClosest to ocean (0,0):\n")
		fmt.Printf("  Name: %s\n", oceanLocation.Name)
		fmt.Printf("  Country Code: %s\n", oceanLocation.CC)
	}
}
```

## Data Source

The geographic data used by GeoDecode is sourced from rg_cities1000.csv. This CSV file contains a list of cities with their coordinates and administrative information. The file is embedded directly into the Go package for ease of use.
